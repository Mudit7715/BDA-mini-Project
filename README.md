# Chicago Traffic Crash Analysis: Patterns, Causes, and Insights

This comprehensive analysis explores traffic crash data from Chicago to identify patterns, contributing factors, and potential areas for intervention. The study applies big data analytics techniques to understand crash dynamics, temporal patterns, and primary contributing factors that lead to traffic accidents in the city.

## Introduction and Project Overview

Traffic crashes remain a significant public safety concern in urban environments, causing injuries, fatalities, and substantial economic costs. Understanding the patterns and contributing factors of these incidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and improving road safety. This project leverages big data analytics to examine traffic crash records from Chicago, aiming to uncover meaningful insights that could inform policy decisions and targeted interventions.

The analysis was conducted using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework ideal for processing large datasets. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, this project identifies temporal patterns, primary crash causes, and other significant factors contributing to traffic incidents. By understanding these patterns, city planners, traffic engineers, and policymakers can make more informed decisions about infrastructure improvements, enforcement strategies, and public education campaigns.

## Dataset Description and Methodology

### Dataset Overview

The analysis utilizes the Chicago traffic crashes dataset, which contains detailed records of traffic incidents reported in the city. This comprehensive dataset includes information about crash circumstances, contributing factors, environmental conditions, vehicle details, and resulting injuries. The dataset's rich feature set enables multi-dimensional analysis of crash patterns and their potential causes.

The dataset contains numerous features including:

- Crash date and time information
- Location details (coordinates, street information)
- Environmental factors (weather, lighting conditions)
- Road conditions and traffic control devices
- Crash types and contributing causes
- Injury severity and counts
- Vehicle information


### Data Processing and Preparation

The data preparation phase involved several critical steps to ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis:

```python
processed_df = crashes_df.withColumn(
    "CRASH_DATE_TS", to_timestamp(col("CRASH_DATE"), "MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss a")) \
    .withColumn("HOUR", hour(col("CRASH_DATE_TS"))) \
    .withColumn("DAY_OF_WEEK", dayofweek(col("CRASH_DATE_TS"))) \
    .withColumn("MONTH", month(col("CRASH_DATE_TS"))) \
    .withColumn("SEASON", when((col("MONTH") &gt;= 3) &amp; (col("MONTH") &lt;= 5), "Spring")
        .when((col("MONTH") &gt;= 6) &amp; (col("MONTH") &lt;= 8), "Summer")
        .otherwise("Fall/Winter")) \
    .withColumn("CRASH_SEVERITY", when(col("INJURIES_TOTAL") &gt; 0, 1).otherwise(0)) \
    .fillna({
        'PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE': 'UNKNOWN',
        'WEATHER_CONDITION': 'UNKNOWN',
        'LIGHTING_CONDITION': 'UNKNOWN',
        'ROADWAY_SURFACE_COND': 'UNKNOWN',
        'TRAFFICWAY_TYPE': 'UNKNOWN'
    })
```

This preprocessing pipeline included:

1. Converting crash dates to timestamp format for temporal analysis
2. Extracting time-based features (hour, day of week, month)
3. Creating a seasonal categorization
4. Developing a crash severity indicator based on injuries
5. Handling missing values in critical categorical fields

These steps created a clean, structured dataset ready for exploratory analysis and visualization, ensuring that insights derived would be based on complete and accurate information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis phase focused on identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the Chicago traffic crash data. Two key aspects were examined in detail: contributing causes and temporal distribution.

### Primary Contributing Causes Analysis

The analysis of primary contributing causes reveals the most common factors leading to traffic crashes in Chicago:

```python
top_causes = processed_df.groupBy("PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE") \
    .count() \
    .orderBy(desc("count")) \
    .limit(10) \
    .toPandas()
```

The visualization of the top 10 contributing causes shows that "FAILING TO YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY" is among the most frequent factors in Chicago traffic crashes. Other significant causes include distracted driving, following too closely, and improper lane usage. This finding highlights the human behavioral aspects of traffic safety, suggesting that many crashes could potentially be prevented through improved driver education and awareness.

The prominence of failure to yield right-of-way as a leading cause indicates a specific area where targeted enforcement and educational campaigns might be particularly effective. This insight could help traffic safety officials develop focused interventions addressing this specific driving behavior.

### Temporal Patterns in Crash Occurrence

The temporal analysis examined how crash frequencies vary throughout the day:

```python
hourly_counts = processed_df.groupBy("HOUR") \
    .count() \
    .orderBy("HOUR") \
    .toPandas()
```

The hourly distribution visualization reveals distinct patterns in crash occurrences throughout the day. The data shows peak periods that likely correspond to morning and evening rush hours, with notable increases in crash frequency during these times. This pattern aligns with expectations about traffic volume and congestion, but provides specific time windows where preventative measures might be most impactful.

The temporal analysis provides valuable information for resource allocation. Traffic enforcement, emergency response preparedness, and public transportation alternatives could be strategically enhanced during these peak crash periods to potentially reduce incident frequency and severity.

## Key Findings and Insights

### Behavioral Factors Dominate Crash Causes

The analysis indicates that human behavioral factors—particularly failure to yield right-of-way, distracted driving, and following too closely—constitute the majority of primary contributing causes for crashes. This finding suggests that traffic safety initiatives focusing on driver behavior modification could potentially have substantial impacts on reducing crash rates.

These behavioral factors are particularly noteworthy because they are potentially addressable through targeted education, enforcement, and awareness campaigns, unlike factors such as weather conditions or vehicle failures which may be less controllable.

### Temporal Patterns Suggest Strategic Intervention Opportunities

The clear temporal patterns in crash distribution throughout the day provide concrete guidance for when traffic safety resources might be most effectively deployed. The identification of peak crash hours enables more strategic planning for:

- Targeted traffic enforcement during high-risk periods
- Variable traffic control measures during peak times
- Public transportation enhancements during rush hours
- Adjusted work schedules to spread out commuter traffic

These patterns also suggest the importance of considering time-of-day factors when evaluating the effectiveness of any traffic safety intervention, as measures that work well during off-peak hours might be insufficient during high-risk periods.

### Environmental Conditions and Infrastructure Considerations

While behavioral factors dominate the primary causes, the dataset also includes information on environmental conditions, road surface conditions, and infrastructure elements that could be analyzed further to identify additional contributing factors. Future analysis could explore these aspects in greater detail to identify potential infrastructure improvements or maintenance priorities.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

This analysis of Chicago traffic crash data has revealed important patterns in crash occurrences and their primary contributing factors. The findings highlight the significant role of human behavior in traffic safety, particularly regarding right-of-way observance and attentive driving. Additionally, the clear temporal patterns in crash frequency provide valuable guidance for when interventions might be most effective.

### Recommendations for Traffic Safety Improvement

1. **Targeted Educational Campaigns**: Develop focused public awareness campaigns addressing the top contributing causes, particularly emphasizing right-of-way rules and the dangers of distracted driving.
2. **Enhanced Enforcement During Peak Hours**: Allocate traffic enforcement resources strategically during identified peak crash periods to maximize impact and visibility.
3. **Infrastructure Assessment**: Evaluate whether high-crash locations correlate with specific infrastructure characteristics that could be improved, particularly at intersections where right-of-way issues are most likely to occur.
4. **Continued Data Analysis**: Expand the analysis to include spatial patterns, demographic factors, and more detailed examination of injury severity correlations to further refine understanding of crash dynamics.
5. **Public Transportation Enhancements**: Consider improvements to public transportation options during peak crash hours to reduce private vehicle traffic volume during high-risk periods.

By applying these insights and recommendations, Chicago could potentially see meaningful improvements in traffic safety outcomes. The data-driven approach demonstrated in this analysis provides a model for how big data analytics can inform practical public safety initiatives and policy decisions.
